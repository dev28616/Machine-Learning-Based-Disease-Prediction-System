## 🩺 Project Overview

The Disease Prediction System leverages multiple machine learning classifiers (like Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM) to predict diseases based on user-reported symptoms. The system analyzes symptom patterns and classifies the likely disease, supporting early diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

---

## ✨ Features

* **Symptom-based Disease Prediction:** Input user symptoms via the interface and receive predicted diseases.
* **Multiple Classifiers:** Implements and compares different machine learning models for improved accuracy.
* **Data Visualization:** Visualizes symptom and disease distributions for better insight.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Interactive UI for symptom input and result display.
* **Model Evaluation:** Includes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall to evaluate model performance.

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset comprises symptom-disease mappings collected from reliable medical sources and consists of:

* A list of symptoms (binary presence/absence per patient)
* Corresponding disease labels

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and convert categorical data for model training.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
* Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
* Web Framework: Flask (if applicable)
* Others: Jupyter Notebook for EDA and experimentation
